# 🧠 Clustering Assignment - Liliane Kayitesi

This project explores unsupervised learning using clustering techniques on a dataset related to **annual income and spending score** of customers. The goal is to segment customers into groups that exhibit similar purchasing behaviors using clustering algorithms.

## 📊 Project Description

Clustering is an important machine learning task used to discover hidden patterns or groupings in data without prior labeling. In this assignment, we:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Visualize the data
- Apply **K-Means clustering**
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**
- Interpret clustering results and visualize them

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset used includes:
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

These features are analyzed to segment customers into groups for targeted marketing or business decisions.

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries

The following libraries are used:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for clustering)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can install required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clustering-assignment.git
cd clustering-assignment
```

### 📂 Project Structure

```
.
├── Clustering_assignment_Liliane_Kayitesi.ipynb
├── README.md
└── (optional) data/
```

### ▶️ Running the Project Locally

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `Clustering_assignment_Liliane_Kayitesi.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the cells in order to see the clustering steps and visualizations.

## 📈 Results

- Optimal number of clusters determined via the **Elbow Method**
- Final clusters visualized using scatter plots
- Insight into how customers group based on spending behavior and income
